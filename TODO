CoCo:
* preface about this being a conceptual build with imperfections and not necessarily efficient
* topological sort diagram
* higher res add neuron animation
  * and fix the inner a tag href
* add Mul, Sub, Div notes in Forward Prop solution
* equations
  * eqn 1 (learning and loss) -> switch i for n
  * math in Linear transform
* double check that all references to value are gone (esp first quiz)
* images
  * forward prop
  * problem with neurons
    * layers
  * linear transform
    * graph reflecting quiz
  * gradient descent
    * so many
  * sigmoid function
    * pixelated '3' from MNIST
    * randomly labeled and correctly labeled '3'
* fix equation numbering start to finish
* `ideal_output` and `actual_output` are confusing. get better names
* n.gradients[n] - gradients[self] on inputs is a bit weird. maybe a different property?

Needs testing:
* forward prop bonus quiz (Ryan is on it)
* drop norm from MSE?

Structure:
* uhhh... is 'categorize' the right word to describe what activation functions do?
* account for Neuron misnomer with Add and Linear?
* mention what I used as a resource (NN book)
  * probably mention that's where MNIST data came from
  * and mnist_loader

Bugs in CoCo:
* add image atom. add text atom. text doesn't save.
